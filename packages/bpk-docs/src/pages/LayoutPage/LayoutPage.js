    blurb: [
      <Paragraph>
        Backpack uses a baseline grid to provide consistent vertical rhythm. A baseline grid is an underlying structure
        that helps guide the vertical spacing of a design. Just like using columns for laying out elements horizontally,
        the baseline grid is a way to help you make decisions and build consistency into a layout.
      </Paragraph>,
      <Paragraph>
        Backpackâ€™s baseline grid is set to .375rem (6px) increments, with an optimised font-size, line-height and
        spacing that align to the grid.
      </Paragraph>,
      <Paragraph>You can preview this by switching on the grid at the bottom of the page.</Paragraph>,

    title: 'Horizontal grid',
    blurb: [
      <Paragraph>
        Backpack uses a 12 column responsive grid to compose and layout pages. Grids are composed using three basic
        building blocks: containers, rows and columns. Containers are used to encapsulate the entire layout (all rows).
        Rows are used to act as container to columns and columns are used to horizontally layout content.
      </Paragraph>,
      <BpkBlockquote>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The Backpack grid is intended to be used for overall page layout as opposed to spacing
        out atom or molecule level components. Please stick to flexbox based techniques for more intricate
        layouts (or <BpkCode>display: table;</BpkCode> for browsers which lack support), just be sure to use the spacing
        values above in order to achieve consistency.
      </BpkBlockquote>,
      <Paragraph>
        <strong>Columns</strong>
      </Paragraph>,
      <Paragraph>
        The grid makes use of 12 percentage based columns, which means your layouts will scale no matter the browser
        size. Columns are separated by fixed width gutters and margins.

      </Paragraph>,
      <Paragraph>
        <strong>Offsets</strong>
      </Paragraph>,
      <Paragraph>
        Offsets allow you to shift columns to the right. Depending on their size, columns can be offset by 1 through 11.

        <strong>Responsive behaviour</strong>
      </Paragraph>,
      <Paragraph>
        The grid works in conjunction with the breakpoints listed above and can be used to position content differently
        based on these viewports by specifying different widths and offsets.
